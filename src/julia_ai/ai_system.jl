Tetris Towers AI System

This module implements the AI system for Tetris Towers, providing intelligent
opponents and gameplay analysis using machine learning techniques.

The AI system is designed to:
1. Control AI opponents with different difficulty levels
2. Analyze player behavior and adapt gameplay
3. Predict optimal block placements
4. Learn from gameplay data to improve over time
